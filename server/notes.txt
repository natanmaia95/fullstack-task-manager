# Creating an npm project
npm init -y
(-y means Yes for all questions on setup)

also edit package.json an add "type": "modules"

# Adding modules we'll use
npm install cors
npm i express
(i means install)

# Add a script so we can run the program easier
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --watch index.js"
  },
(--watch means it refreshes with file changes)
now we can call
    npm start
to run the back end server.
